## 🚀 Features

### 🧩 Core Modules
- 📝 **Civic & Disaster Issue Reporting**  
  Report problems (potholes, floods, etc.) with images and geolocation.

- 🧠 **AI Image Verification**  
  Gemini API is used to detect fake/irrelevant images in disaster reports.

- 🧍‍♂️ **Missing/Accused Person Search**  
  Upload a person’s photo — facial recognition triggers alerts if matched on CCTV feeds.

- 📍 **Heatmaps & Alerts**  
  Visualize report clusters and receive real-time disaster warnings.

- 🧑‍💼 **Admin Dashboard**  
  Filter, verify, and manage citizen reports with secure login (Supabase Auth).

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Volunteer Coordination**  
  Match volunteers to issues with live status updates and gamification.
